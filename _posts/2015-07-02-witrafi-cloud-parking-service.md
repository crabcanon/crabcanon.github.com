description: Witrafi Parking Cloud is a comprehensive system which main functions are to show parking availability on streets and provide parking payments. It also handles parking permits, for example those supplied to city residents. The cloud platform is able to utilize information from many different real-time updating data sources. I was hired to develop the front-end of Witrafi Parking Cloud by employing AngularJS, GoogleMap APIs and <a href="https://solinor.fi/">Solinor Payment APIs</a>.
