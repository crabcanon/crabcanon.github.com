With Aemdee’s online service, doctors and other health care staff will be able to monitor their patients’ condition and development remotely. I was involved in design and development of Aemdee web service as a full-stack developer by using Ruby on Rails, BackboneJS, jQuery, D3js, CoffeeScript, Bootstrap and MySQL.
