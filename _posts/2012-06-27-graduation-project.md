PS: This video evokes many memories and has some deep imprints of that era. I put it here is not because I want to show a fantastic app, instead, I want to tell how my amazing journey of web development starts. I was a beginner at that time, more amateur than what you could imagine, but I still developed a good-looking one with Windows XP, Adobe Flex and my coolest IBM T60P.
