PS: This video evokes many memories and has some deep imprints of that era. I put it here is not because I want to show a fantastic webapp, instead, I want to present how my amazing journey of web development starts. I was a beginner at that time, more amateur than what you can imagine, but I still develop a good-looking webapp with Windows XP and Adobe Flex.
