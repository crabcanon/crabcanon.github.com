It's been a while that I didn't update my personal website, also speak or write in English. A long spring festival for most Chinese people due to the outbreak of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia. Though I returned to work a bit earlier than most people, I didn't have to work very late as everyone prefer to reduce time spent with other people. What surprised me was my country could let 1.4 billion citizens wear masks over just one night. 

As I had more time to stay at home again, I started to gain inspirations by thinking and exploration. Like today, I have to record some memory pieces just in case.

- Apache Kylin: An MOLAP-based Engine for big data. A cube is formed by a set of cuboids, and each cuboid is a multi-dimensional data model which consists of dimensions and measures.
- A Cuboid Spanning Tree: the root node contains all the dimensions, and are decremented along with the growth of tree. Some nodes are redundant in real OLAP analysis scenarios, which could be cut off to reduce space and increase performance.  
- Tree Visualization
  - Each node can be clicked and corresponding multi-dimentional table would be presented.
  - An initial layout could be automatically generated by some base algorithms, such as circle, concentric, grid, radial, dagre, force, and so on. However, it could be more intelligent if some parameters which contain a real scene logic could be introduced.
