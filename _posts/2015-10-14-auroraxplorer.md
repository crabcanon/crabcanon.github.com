description: AuroraXplorer works with the travel industry by designing, marketing and selling their services to Chinese travellers, directly online, and through boutique travel agencies and other offline sales channels. Their travel partners come from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, France, and Italy. Our network of Chinese travel agencies comprises 35 companies with several hundred retail stores. I was hired to develop the front-end side of AuroraXplorer mobile web app by using Ionic and AngularJS.
