description: <a href="http://www.finmeas.com/">FinMeas Ltd</a> is a Finnish measurement technology and service expert. This project is to develop a HTML5 hybrid mobile app (iOS/Android/WP) to monitor and maintain the status of measurement devices and detailed information of POIs managed by FinMeasâ€™s Internet service. I was one of the project coordinators and my responsibilities were proposing a initial technical architecture, constructing mobile app mockups, managing the project and testing softwares before the final version of productions. AngularJS and Sencha Touch were used for mockups. Other tools including Jira, Bitbucket and Slack.
