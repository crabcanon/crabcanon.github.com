## About the website

* This website is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* The theme is forked from [Monospace](https://github.com/muan/muan.github.com/releases/tag/v5.0.1-monospace), originally designed by [@muan](https://github.com/muan).
* I re-constructed parts of the original functionalities, including search/sort blogs(by date, categories or tags), independent pages for "About" & "Projects" and code highlighter to satisfy my personal demands.
* Finally, I really appreciate [@muan](https://github.com/muan)'s work and I would say this is one of the best themes I have ever seen in the past two years.
